</div>

## Getting Started

This project is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app that uses the [Abstract Global Wallet SDK](https://github.com/Abstract-Foundation/agw-sdk) with Family's [web3-react](https://github.com/Uniswap/web3-react) to allow users to sign into the app.

### Local Development

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

Open your browser and navigate to [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) to see the app in action.
